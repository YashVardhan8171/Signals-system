This MATLAB code is designed to process audio data from one WAV file provided by the user. It applies a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter to the audio signal, computes the magnitude spectrum of the filtered signal using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and then plots the magnitude spectrum on a graph.

Here's a step-by-step description of the code:

1. Initialize variables:
   - `num_inputs`: Number of WAV files that the user wants to process. In this code, it is set to 1.
   - `filenames`: A cell array to store the names of the WAV files.
   - `audio_data`: A cell array to hold the audio data read from each WAV file.
   - `sampling_rate_of_each_file`: A numeric array to store the sample rate of each WAV file.

2. Define filter coefficients:
   - `filter_order`: Order of the FIR filter to be applied to the audio signal. A higher order generally provides a better frequency response but requires more computational resources.
   - `filter_cutoff`: Cutoff frequency of the filter in Hz. The filter will attenuate frequencies above this cutoff value.

3. Loop through each audio file:
   - A `for` loop is used to process each audio file (in this case, it runs only once since `num_inputs` is 1).
   - The user is prompted to enter the name of the WAV file. The entered filename is stored in the `filenames` cell array.
   - The audio data and the sampling rate are read from the WAV file using the `audioread` function, and they are stored in the corresponding indices of the `audio_data` cell array and the `sampling_rate_of_each_file` numeric array, respectively.

4. Apply the FIR filter to the signal:
   - The FIR filter coefficients are computed using the `fir1` function based on the specified filter order and cutoff frequency.
   - The filter is applied to the audio data using the `filter` function, resulting in the `audio_data_filtered`.

5. Compute the frequency axis and magnitude spectrum:
   - The length of the filtered audio data (`N`) is computed.
   - The frequency axis (`freqs`) is generated from 0 Hz to the Nyquist frequency (half the sampling rate) with a frequency resolution of `sampling_rate_of_each_file(i)/N` Hz.
   - Only the positive half of the spectrum is kept since the negative half is symmetrical due to the nature of real-valued audio signals.
   - The FFT of the filtered audio data is computed using the `fft` function, and the magnitudes of the FFT coefficients (`mags`) are calculated using the `abs` function.

6. Plot the magnitude spectrum:
   - A subplot is created for each audio file to display the magnitude spectrum.
   - The line color of the plot is set to pink (`[1, 0.4, 0.6]`).
   - The frequency axis (`freqs`) is plotted on the x-axis, and the magnitude spectrum (`mags`) is plotted on the y-axis.
   - The title of each subplot shows the index of the audio file (`i`) and the filename of the corresponding WAV file.

Note: The code assumes that the input WAV files are mono (single-channel) audio signals. If the WAV file contains multiple channels, additional modifications would be needed to handle the multi-channel data properly. Additionally, the code applies a single FIR filter to the entire audio signal; for more complex signal processing tasks, multiple filters or other filtering techniques might be required.
